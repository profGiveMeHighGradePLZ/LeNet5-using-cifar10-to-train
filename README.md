In the US, bank checks with handwritten digits were automatically classified using LeNet-5 on a large scale. 

LeNet-5 is a very basic network by today's standards. It only has seven layers total: the output layer is positioned after two sub-sampling (pooling) layers (S2 and S4), one fully connected layer (F6), and three convolutional layers (C1, C3, and C5). 5 by 5 convolutions with stride 1 are used in convolutional layers. Two by two average pooling layers are sub-sampling layers. The network as a whole uses tanh sigmoid activations. LeNet-5 made a number of intriguing architectural decisions that are uncommon in the current deep learning era.
